🎨 Interactive Components & Design System

## Component Architecture
All interactive components follow a consistent design pattern with enhanced visual feedback, drag-based interactions, and mobile-first responsive design. Components are built using React with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Core Design Principles
- **Mobile-First**: All components designed for touch interaction first
- **Visual Consistency**: Uniform card heights, consistent spacing, and aligned layouts
- **Interactive Feedback**: Hover effects, selection states, and smooth transitions
- **Color Psychology**: Green for positive/efficient, red for problematic, blue for neutral
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed gradually

## Standard Component Types

### 1. Visual Grid Selectors
**Used for**: Checkbox and radio questions with visual categories
**Pattern**: Grid layout with icon-based cards
**Features**:
- Perfect height alignment using `h-full` and `min-h-[120px]`

- Description text for each option
- Visual hierarchy with size/color

**Example Questions**:
- Timeline urgency (`timeline_urgency`)

## Component Implementation Details

### Visual Grid Selector Structure
```typescript
// Grid container with perfect alignment
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  {options.map((option) => (
    <button className="relative h-full min-h-[120px] p-6 rounded-xl border-2 transition-all duration-300 text-left group overflow-hidden flex flex-col justify-between">
      {/* Background gradient for selected state */}
      {isSelected && <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br {colorClass} opacity-5" />}

      {/* Icon and content structure */}
      <div className="relative space-y-4 flex-1">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <div className="p-3 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
            <IconComponent className="w-6 h-6" />
          </div>
          {isSelected && <CheckCircle2 className="w-4 h-4 text-white" />}
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-2 flex-1 flex flex-col justify-center">
          <div className="text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-wide">Category</div>
          <div className="font-semibold leading-tight">Option Label</div>
          <div className="text-sm">Description</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </button>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Interactive Slider Structure
```typescript
// Main value display
<div className="text-center">
  <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-blue-600">{selectedValue}</div>
  <div className="text-lg text-gray-600">Description</div>
</div>

// Interactive slider track
<div className="relative px-4">
  <div className="relative h-3 bg-gray-200 rounded-full">
    {/* Progress fill with dynamic color */}
    <div className="h-full bg-gradient-to-r {colorClass} rounded-full transition-all duration-200"
         style={{ width: `${(currentIndex / (options.length - 1)) * 100}%` }} />

    {/* Draggable handle */}
    <div className="absolute top-1/2 w-6 h-6 bg-white rounded-full shadow-lg border-2 border-blue-600 transform -translate-y-1/2 cursor-pointer"
         style={{ left: `calc(${(currentIndex / (options.length - 1)) * 100}% - 12px)` }} />
  </div>

  {/* Hidden range input for dragging */}
  <input type="range" min="0" max={options.length - 1} value={currentIndex}
         onChange={(e) => handleChange(parseInt(e.target.value))}
         className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-6 opacity-0 cursor-pointer" />
</div>
```

## Color System

### Primary Colors
- **Blue**: `from-blue-500 to-blue-600` - Neutral selections, primary actions
- **Green**: `from-green-500 to-green-600` - Positive/efficient states
- **Red**: `from-red-500 to-red-600` - Problematic/critical states
- **Orange**: `from-orange-500 to-orange-600` - Warning/moderate states
- **Purple**: `from-purple-500 to-purple-600` - Special categories

### Gradient Patterns
- **Background Gradients**: `bg-gradient-to-br {color} opacity-5` for selected states
- **Progress Bars**: `bg-gradient-to-r {color}` for slider fills
- **Icon Backgrounds**: `bg-gradient-to-br {color}` for selected icons

## Animation & Interaction Patterns

### Hover Effects
```css
hover:border-blue-300 hover:shadow-md hover:transform hover:scale-102
```

### Selection States
```css
border-blue-600 bg-white shadow-lg transform scale-105
```

### Transitions
```css
transition-all duration-300
```

## Responsive Design Patterns

### Grid Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: `grid-cols-1` (single column)
- **Tablet**: `md:grid-cols-2` (two columns)
- **Desktop**: `lg:grid-cols-3` or `lg:grid-cols-4` (three/four columns)

### Touch Optimization
- Minimum touch target: 44x44px
- Slider handles: 24x24px with larger touch area
- Card padding: 24px (p-6) for comfortable touch zones

## Component Naming Convention

### Component Files
- **Location**: `src/components/tools/audit/enhanced-working-service-quiz.tsx`
- **Naming**: `{Purpose}{Type}` (e.g., `LeadGenerationMethodsSelector`, `ConversationVolumeSlider`)

### Question ID Mapping
Components are mapped to question IDs in the QuestionRenderer:
```typescript
if (question.id === 'question_id') {
  return <CustomComponent question={question} value={value} onChange={onChange} />
}
```
