# VeloxForce Technical Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive technical analysis of the VeloxForce website codebase, with a specific focus on the Service Quiz implementation, Supabase integration, and overall architecture. The codebase represents a modern Next.js 14 application implementing a business automation consultancy's "Service-as-Software" solution.

## 1. Service Quiz Implementation

### 1.1 Architecture Overview

The Service Quiz is a sophisticated multi-step assessment tool designed to evaluate department-specific automation potential. It follows a branching logic pattern based on user selections.

**Key Components:**
- `/src/app/tools/service-quiz/page.tsx` - Main quiz page entry point
- `/src/components/tools/audit/working-service-quiz.tsx` - Primary quiz component (simplified version)
- `/src/config/service-quiz.ts` - Comprehensive quiz configuration with all routes

### 1.2 Quiz Flow Structure

```
1. Introduction Phase
   └── Department Selection (6 options)
       
2. Opening Context Questions (All Routes)
   ├── Company Size
   ├── User Role
   └── Business Model

3. Department-Specific Routes
   ├── Sales & Business Development (4 phases)
   ├── Finance & Administration (4 phases)
   ├── Customer Service & Support (multiple phases)
   ├── Operations & Fulfillment (multiple phases)
   ├── Marketing & Communications (multiple phases)
   └── Human Resources (multiple phases)

4. Final Questions (All Routes)
   ├── Timeline & Budget
   └── Contact Information
```

### 1.3 Question Types Implementation

The quiz supports 16 different question types:
- `text` - Basic text input
- `radio` - Single selection
- `checkbox` - Multiple selection
- `visual_grid` - Visual department selector with icons
- `conditional_checkbox` - Dynamic options based on previous answers
- `time_breakdown` - Time allocation across categories
- `team_breakdown` - Team resource allocation
- `dual_slider` - Two related sliders (e.g., incoming/outgoing invoices)
- `time_matrix` - Time estimation for multiple tasks
- `system_count` - Count of systems/tools used
- `percentage_sliders` - Must total 100%
- `contact_form` - Structured contact details
- `select` - Dropdown selection
- `slider` - Single value slider
- Plus specialized variants

### 1.4 Data Collection Logic

The `WorkingServiceQuiz` component manages state through:
```typescript
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<'intro' | 'opening' | 'department' | 'route' | 'final' | 'results'>('intro')
const [selectedDepartment, setSelectedDepartment] = useState<string>("")
const [currentQuestionIndex, setCurrentQuestionIndex] = useState(0)
const [answers, setAnswers] = useState<Record<string, any>>({})
```

Progress tracking calculates total questions across all phases dynamically based on the selected department route.

### 1.5 Scoring System

While the simplified component doesn't show scoring, the configuration reveals:
- Questions have optional `score` properties
- Department-specific scoring weights
- ROI calculations based on:
  - Time saved (hours/week)
  - Cost reduction (€/week)
  - Annual projections

## 2. Supabase Integration

### 2.1 Database Schema

Three primary tables handle quiz data:

```sql
-- clients table
- id (uuid, primary key)
- email (unique)
- phone_number
- name
- company_name
- created_at
- updated_at

-- quiz_submissions table
- id (uuid, primary key)
- client_id (foreign key)
- process_name_input
- selected_process_type
- calculated_score
- result_category
- submitted_at
- ai_analysis_status (enum: pending, processing, complete, failed)
- ai_report_sent_at
- department_route (for service quiz)

-- quiz_answers table
- id (uuid, primary key)
- submission_id (foreign key)
- question_id
- answer_value
- answer_score
- created_at
```

### 2.2 API Route Implementation

The `/src/app/api/submit-quiz/route.ts` handles both legacy and new quiz submissions:

1. **Dual Quiz Support**: Detects quiz type via `departmentRoute` property
2. **Upsert Pattern**: Updates existing clients or creates new ones based on email
3. **Transaction Flow**:
   - Upsert client data
   - Create quiz submission
   - Batch insert all answers
   - Update AI analysis status

### 2.3 Security Configuration

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Public insert/update policies for audit tool accessibility
- Environment variables for secure connection:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_KEY`

## 3. General Codebase Architecture
