              As a leader, is your day consumed by operational details and firefighting, leaving no room for strategy or innovation? Do you find yourself constantly pulled into decisions that should be handled at lower levels? Are your most important strategic initiatives perpetually delayed because urgent operational matters always take precedence?
            </Text>
            <Text>
              This strategic time drain isn't just a personal productivity issue‚Äîit's a fundamental business constraint that limits growth, innovation, and competitive advantage. When leaders are trapped in operational details, the organization can only grow to the limits of their personal capacity to manage those details. The true cost isn't measured in hours lost, but in opportunities missed and growth potential unrealized.
