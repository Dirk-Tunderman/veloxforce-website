## Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for system operation
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your_openrouter_key

# Optional for enhanced features
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://veloxforce.ai
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Enhanced `audit_quiz_answers` Table
```sql
- question_text (text) -- NEW: Full question text
- question_id (text)   -- Existing: Question identifier
- answer_value (text)  -- Existing: User's answer
```

### Enhanced `audit_quiz_submissions` Table  
```sql
- department_route (text)    -- NEW: Department selection
- ai_analysis_status (text)  -- NEW: Processing status
- process_name_input (text)  -- Existing: Process description
```

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Quiz Submission
```typescript
// User completes service quiz
const submission = {
  contactDetails: { /* contact info */ },
  quizAnswers: { /* all answers */ },
  departmentRoute: "hr",
  summary: { /* calculated metrics */ }
}

// Submit via API
await fetch('/api/submit-quiz', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(submission)
})
```

### 2. Automatic Processing
1. **Database Storage**: Quiz data saved with enhanced question text
2. **Website Analysis**: Client's website scraped and analyzed
3. **AI Processing**: Business intelligence analysis performed
4. **Report Generation**: Professional PDF created
5. **Email Delivery**: Report sent to client automatically

### 3. Report Contents
Each report includes:
- **Executive Summary**: Business overview and key findings
- **Current State Analysis**: Industry positioning and challenges
- **Automation Opportunities**: Specific areas for improvement with ROI
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phase-by-phase transformation plan
- **Financial Projections**: Investment requirements and returns

## Error Handling

### Graceful Failures
- Website scraping failures â†’ Continue with limited analysis
- AI API failures â†’ Send error notification email
- PDF generation failures â†’ Log error and notify support
- Email delivery failures â†’ Retry with fallback options

### Monitoring & Logging
- Comprehensive console logging throughout pipeline
- Database status tracking for all submissions
- Error notifications to both client and support team
- Performance metrics for optimization

## Performance Considerations

### Asynchronous Processing
- Report generation runs independently of quiz submission response
- Prevents timeout issues for complex analyses
- Status tracking allows progress monitoring

### Resource Optimization
- Puppeteer browser instance management
- Rate limiting for respectful website scraping
- Caching strategies for repeated analyses
- Memory management for large PDF generation

## Testing & Validation

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
node scripts/test-report-generation.js

# Tests included:
# - API endpoint accessibility
# - Environment variable validation
# - Quiz submission flow
# - Report generation pipeline
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Start development server
npm run dev

# 2. Submit test quiz via form or API
# 3. Monitor console logs for processing status
# 4. Check email for generated report
# 5. Validate PDF content and formatting
```
