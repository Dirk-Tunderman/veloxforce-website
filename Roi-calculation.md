so in this video I'm going to talk about how we calculate the ROI of our Aentic operating systems we use a six-step ROI calculation framework now it kind of varies based on the use case to be honest with you uh but this is directionally correct on typically like what we do right and and realistically like we've started to do like these AI development blueprints prior to actually development because um it just became like abundantly clear that we need to one like scope more accurately so we can quote more accurately on like how difficult the stuff actually is to build sometimes and then two like what is what is like the true value of the systems that we're building and are we charging and pricing accordingly now we don't want to go crazy but there's certainly some times where like we we totally under undercharge there's obviously six steps here the first four are the main kind of meat and potatoes of it and then cost trends and scaling define success and decide these are kind of like how do we how do we say like okay this system's working or not uh and then how do we make that decision and then also what is what do things look like over time right if we project it out from a cost perspective as we scale the case study that we're going to use in this case is a real one right a law firm that represents uh insurance companies it's personal injury defense about 33 people in size we're specifically looking at the uh administrative function like the legal assistant workflows right and so they have six of those a lot of those workflows are like scheduling with opposing councils clients and others right ensuring everyone stays on deadline there's a lot of like really clear um important like rules to follow and like every court has their own kind of like calendar uh document generation document filing billing entry management some of these things are kind of tedious uh but like super important super important for the firm so step one current state analysis first thing we want to do is get a handle on what what are things where are things at currently from a cost perspective in order to produce the outcomes uh that you know we're looking to replace here which roles are involved in ensuring the legal assistant workflows produce not product produce the required outcome in this case we have two roles right legal assistant which is very clear by the way the calculating labor cost is is step one and is probably the easiest thing to do and where most people stop right it's just like are we cutting opex which like obviously like that's the point you know we can't just stop there in terms of calculating ROI legal assistance six people 66K a year right we tacked on a 30% addition for benefits which might be a little bit aggressive but given this specific scenario it made sense essentially it costs $515,000 a year to support six legal assistants and then parallegals step in when mistakes are made right which is part of the reason why the system's getting built to begin with it's like these parallegals are spending 5 to 10 hours a week stepping in to kind of like clean up messes or support or do rework or whatever right when legal assistants you know can't do it we calculate that like hey you know typical rate 45 bucks an hour uh for a parallegal which might be high if you're a parallegal watching this we we average right so there there's some parallegals who've been there for like years right who are making more than 90k and then a lot that are making less so the average was about 90k and across all the parallegals everybody we basically calculated where it's like hey you know a quarter of a parallegal is spending time basically stepping in right to ensure things are you know the outcomes are good so total labor cost we're looking at about $545,000 key point cost 515K to execute the legal assistant workflows for legal assistant salaries an additional cost of about 30K when parillegals need to step in and this is just a starting point right this is the easiest thing to calculate a harder thing to calculate is inefficiencies and it's hard because a lot of times there are just baked in you know you kind of just see them as like cost of doing business right like a person only you can only expect a person to work 40 hours a week you can expect them to work at a certain speed a certain pace for certain workflows right so there's no necessary necessarily like expectation of like working uh extraordinarily fast right because the technology hasn't existed uh now it does and so now we can say like okay look this is taking 5 hours but our system can do it in 10 minutes technically whatever you're doing now because there's a tool out there that can do it way faster 99% faster there are inefficiencies right and we didn't even calculate that here these are just inefficiencies in just the current state of things so errors and mistakes execution delays and missed deadlines manual data entry uh and then when the parallegal has to step in and fix it when a parallegal has to step in there's a lot of lost opportunities for them to do like other high value work on their cases parallegals their time costs more and so whenever they have to step in it's just it's tacking on costs right so a mistake costs more and then we want to calculate the opportunity cost now this is one that we are now starting to implement you usually don't get to this point until you've actually truly mapped out what the system's going to uh be but we obviously got to that point you can either add it or you cannot add it because there are a lot of assumptions right so like if we increase capacity what does that mean right if there's a 20% increase in capacity what does that mean to to the top line right revenue if we're working through cases a lot faster what does that mean and like quicker billing cycles if clients are staying on longer right because like we're assuming that the service gets better people get responded to faster right they get the documents on time all that if you win more cases right so we're saying hey you know legal assistant probably you can you can allocate about 5% out of the 100% of like okay this win who is responsible for the fact that we won this case we did a conservative like five you know legal assistant is probably you can allocate 5% uh 247 after hours intake that's actually kind of a big one because people just start calling attorneys and say "Hey hey are you available hey are you available hey can you represent me hey can you represent me?" If you don't answer the phone you're not getting the business key point here is the true cost is about a million dollars and even if you took out the opportunity cost the 370K in opportunity cost you're still looking at about $200,000 in hidden costs if you add it in there you're looking at 570K of hidden costs right which is pretty significant but you're not going to see it it's not it's not money out the bank right it's just loss agent OS opportunity analysis so how much is this going to cost and what are the ongoing costs after that and then what are the expected returns right what what are the improvements we're looking at so calculating one-time implementation again this is from the perspective of the client themselves not us not the people who are building it the cost to them or fee 50k right which is a discounted rate because we're going to own the IP we're going to productize this thing he didn't want to own IP but he wanted to get a rep share um and basically in order to help us like develop this product uh we offered a discount software migration so they used a really old really old case management platform called Aderant Total Office looks like it's from the '90s there's obviously no API connection first thing that we did when we saw it was like we need to do research and get them off of this thing so we found Cleo they've signed up for Cleo it's going to cost $130 per seat 33 people over 12 months 50k about and then they had like an add-on service to migrate the data we we actually looking back we probably should have just done it ourselves but they had this as part of like their whole package so it was like yeah why not i mean they know the Cleo platform better than we do like let's just speed it up they ended up taking forever doing that so next time we'll probably just do it ourselves and the cost is going to end up being about 5 to 10K instead of four because it took so long uh infrastructure setup so this is kind of all these are the costs that we're bearing right to keep the system running and to make it so that the client just sees like one invoice a month or one invoice when it's time to pay um as opposed to like a bunch of line items of stuff right so in we're going to use like a a free community version that we're self-hosting superbase we're self-hosting the server cost is going to be and where the cost is going to fall to which we're just estimating 5K we don't we don't know exact we don't have enough data yet to know what to expect from a usage perspective um any additional tools integrations obviously is included integrating into Microsoft and Cleo UI is included training and documentation all that's included right which you would expect and then we have the LLMs and this the the usage man i mean there's tons of calculators out there to try to figure out like what your usage is going to be it's it's it's difficult to to even it's difficult if you're out there thinking like "Oh man I got to really figure out what potential usage costs are going to be." Like clients keep asking like most of the time it's it's very very negligible in this case we put about 20K because there's a lot of document processing there's a lot of tokens that are going to be coming in and out of this thing and we put the popular models here to you know indicate the price what we probably will end up doing is pulling a model off of Hugging Face an open source model and hosting that ourselves because one it'll be cheaper and two uh I just don't trust these guy like OpenAI Google like Enthropic sure they don't train on our data when they're having their connectors or the MCPs going and crawling our our stuff and pulling like our data off of like Google Drive or something like sure but they are grabbing our inputs into the chat and the output that it produces right that that's exactly what they want they want to see human queries and the output that it produces and whether or not the human thinks it's good so that little thumb up thumb down that nobody does I guarantee there's some kind of algorithm that's like analyzing the conversation in the thread and trying to figure out the sentiment on whether or not it was a good response or not so that way they can decrease the amount of tokens that are being outputed and just get to the answer like that the user wants like faster so yeah sure you know you're not looking at like our data but like you're looking at our data come on uh so total initial investment we're looking at 131k which could be less if we uh host our own model and so our 50k fee includes like development integration training like research and vetting of the new case management platform uh it includes like the UI component it includes all of that right in the license ongoing cost so our license not in the license in the initial setup here's the license so I I I threw up here uh 72K we haven't obviously deployed it to uh other firms yet um you know we were told you know about 5k a month maybe 75k 7500 uh a month is is what firms would be willing to spend on this especially because it's not replacing one legal assistant it's supposed to take over the whole function of legal assistance and so we were like okay you know a little bit higher than a typical legal assistant but we're going to save you know 5k a month for now we'll see software licenses obviously they have to keep playing paying for Cleo right it's going to be 50k a year pretty much uh LM costs included servers all that included maintenance monitoring included and then we suggested like keep let's let's keep one like your best uh legal assistant let's keep them on board um just in case i mean you never know it's it's nice to have a human around like let's let's be honest total annual operating cost comes out to about 200k right 193 so the point is like this is a managed solution which is like a term managed solution uh meaning we own the product and the IP 100% and we license it back to the client right at a slightly higher rate than like the salary of one LA again it's supposed to be doing the job of six plus so slightly higher than a like one LA salary this client received a pretty large discount on the initial development and then we wiped the actual the first year licensing fees as well obviously because there's like a little bit of R&D involved they're the first client right it's not like an established product this is a new thing entirely um but we get to keep the IP we get to productize it later right so pretty good deal for us we would have charged more if it wasn't the case benefit projections so once we implement the system what kind of like benefits are we supposed to get back from this thing cost reductions and productivity gains labor reduction pretty easy right salary reduction definitely don't need five legal assistants anymore so it's 330K gone right from your cost parallegal support reduction even though you're not going to see it as a line item that's still like time that costs money right and then process improvements if we we reduce the errors if the execution time speeds up dramatically what does that mean right from a value perspective the error reduction one is the um interesting one because some errors are like pretty devastating other errors are are not so devastating key point savings are calculated per legal assistant the aentic system handles the workflows for at least six legal assistants obviously for process improvement that is per legal assistant i think salary reduction we did it correct that's one legal assistant revenue increases this is also difficult for admin uh administrative roles operational roles it's really hard to project like the the revenue increase uh but in this case there's a couple of variables that we can pull in to to be directionally correct so capacity expansion right so accurate billing entries this is the biggest this is one of the biggest ones because the client for them their clients are insurance companies those insurance companies are disputing every invoice they get like every single one it's like hey did you really spend an hour doing this did it really cost this to do that and so if your billing entries are not accurate or they don't follow the the right template or whatever then they're going to dispute it even if you win that dispute and you push back there's still like time and money involved and like fighting it um and then a lot of times they just don't pay you like they it's just like hey you know this doesn't follow the framework uh we're not going to pay right so there's a lot of loss money there new case throughput i think 20% increase in case load is probably pretty aggressive as I'm looking at this like 20% yeah that's pretty aggressive win rate lift can we see a 5% increase in like win rate some of these I'm like you know it would be cool but like there's so many other variables involved in the win rate that it's like a client retention 5% lower churn if we could somehow uh attribute the legal assistance what they do and how they do it to like client churn um which you know we're we're we're guessing right and these were numbers that were cross-cheed with clients so like and then always on access so you know if if your if your client or somebody that you've worked with in the past a firm is like calling their rolodex of attorneys to like represent them on something and they need it quick and it's 2 a.m and you're not the you're not going to answer the phone and you were the first call you lose that business because they're going to call the next guy and the next guy is going to answer the phone so 24 uh hour service like being able to like schedule and triage things and uh you know answer inbounds like that's huge it's huge so the key point is like I said calculating revenue increase for operations and admin roles is not very straightforward most of the numbers here are estimates right educated guesses u but the system's going to execute legal assistant workflows faster and more accurately that's true it's going to work 24/7 and it's going to handle the job of at least six people so like all that stuff's true and it should lead to or it will lead to an increase in capacity to take on more cases more time for the attorneys and the parallegals to spend on cases which means you know ideally more cases are won uh which means that they should be getting more net new clients and return existing clients more existing clients as a result now we do the ROI calculation so we've projected the benefits we've projected the costs now we kind of figure out okay what is the return on investment over certain time horizons so year one year one is the most important year to calculate uh 12 to 18 months that range most important range to calculate so total cost you want to take the initial plus the operating obviously add that up you get the total looking at about 330K net benefit benefit minus cost right benefit meaning like revenue it's not just revenue but it's also like you know you gotten certain you you've gotten time back and we've translated that to a certain dollar amount right and so you add up those dollar amounts and so that's the benefit so you take your benefit subtract that from costs you get about 430k and then you get your ROI net benefit divided by total cost times 100 131% ROI within the first year right is the expectation and then you can say like man that's like insane like I you know there's not a lot of RO high ROI things that you can invest in to give you 131% the first year um yeah but there's not a lot of tools like AI that exists right like that's the reason why people are uh freaking out about it is because like it's very obvious even if you just stopped at the opex decrease Like it's very obvious that ROI is going to be felt assuming that it can it can produce like the the same if not better outcome right at the end of the day can't be a worse outcome in some cases payback period monthly benefit about 35k payback in 37 months 3.7 months says 8 to9 month ramp up anyway that that's kind of like ramping up into like building it and then building out all the workflows right and adding workflow testing adding workflow testing over time like it'll be deployed five with a certain capability set to begin with and then improved and so that's ramp up multi-year return so now let's take that first year and try to project it over a 5year time horizon things get hairy at year three right like like you can see the benefits here are just like static that's kind of like our one constant obviously the benefits are going to change over time right like there's no way we could be completely accurate i don't think I've ever seen a projection ever a financial projection that has been accurate like 100% accurate the idea is to be directionally correct conservatively directionally correct and so year 1 we're obviously looking at 131 as the ROI and then by year five we're looking at 2200 right so you can see how crazy this gets uh and you're probably thinking "Wow that's like that's too crazy." Uh it's not actually because the operating expense goes down over time and even if you keep the benefit the same the fact that the operating expenses are going down means that the ROI is going to increase right and we'll we'll get into why operating costs expenses go down key point ROI total ROI is calculated by the cumulative cumulative net benefit divided by the initial investment right so the cumulative net benefit here I'm pointing it like you guys can see that but cumulative net benefit divided by initial investment 131 cost trends and scaling over time so those first four like I said are like the key the meat potatoes to find the ROI right this is to see okay if we uh project this out over time where do we think the costs are going to be and then what does scaling mean like economies of scale but then also costs uh that you incur as you scale so the LLM costs OpenAI and Enthropic cut their uh usage costs their their like uh token prices by 50% uh in one year I don't think that that's going to be like an ongoing trend of 50% cut um so we we basically put 15% annual decline in those costs and honestly 50% is insane it it's it's basically tells you why they are so aggressively trying to capture the application layer it's because their models aren't going to be worth anything they're they're they're just a commodity at the end like the the open source models are they might be two years behind forever but at a certain point they will be free and you know aside from like the usage which you have to you can you can host and and pay for yourself there's no tack on right there's no take I I think that they they obviously can foresee that like the models themselves are going to have zero value but like the applications that use the models will have value Right which is why Sam Alman and Johnny IV are hugging each other on like promo videos uh and you know Anthropic is is doing their Claw Code and their projects and artifacts and stuff it it's the reason why they're trying to capture the application layer like that's the whole that's the whole point right it's also why Sam Alman's doing like a hardware device as cool as it is and I'm a big hardware device guy as well it's like clear that like it's going to be about expanding the scope of data that can be captured and ingested and processed by the LMS so like the more wearables we have the more sensors that are out the more data we can capture uh like that that will be like the value in addition to like the application layer where like users are using the models to do stuff right models themselves worth nothing same workflow cost about 45% less by year five with that's with our 15% annual decline and then yeah our model already baked it into the operating cost that's why I said operating costs were going down scaling economics so once we build the agentic OS the foundation of the system adding more workflows and capabilities is it's just a matter of like the usage costs right it's just like more token more tokens being processed obviously every extra user you add to Cleo is going to be an additional 130 b a month right and then the platforms this is how you get the economies of scale like Naden Superbase all the tools that we're using even the models like they the the cost scale sublinearly meaning like every additional unit of cost is smaller each time you add it on and and and this is sublinearly right it's not like exponentially getting smaller like it's a curve right it's it's just like a it's just a line and and that that means like all of these savings flow to IBIDA right it just means like margins increase so the cost that it takes to do something is this right and then every time you're doing something you know the cost goes down you do it again cost goes down costs go down like the rate of growth on the costs is decreasing right hopefully that makes sense basically just means your margins expand fiveyear cost benefit curves so how the ROI compounds over time and it does start to compound so you see we have traditional costs right traditionally the costs are going to scale over time because you need to add more headcounts there's usually more benefits right people people's salaries need to grow uh at least at the rate of inflation i mean that would be cool but at least at the rate of inflation people get whatever right there's there's all kinds of costs associated with scaling a company traditionally then we have the AI costs which we are showing decreasing pretty significantly because we think that the technology is going to be a lot cheaper uh and so those costs will decline which means the savings increase which means your cumulative ROI increases over time right and once it gets to these like multi000 numbers you're you start to just like like man is this even realistic the thing is it is realistic which is why everyone's freaking out about all this stuff uh because it's crazy um yeah traditional costs grow about 5% per year salaries and benefits AI operating costs fall about 15% per year cumulative ROI is net total net savings divided by the initial spend which was 131 and so obviously like by year three it's exceeding 100% of cumulative ROI right pretty crazy define success and decide so you might think like oh okay like year three over a,000% year one 131% like it's a done deal go it it was a done deal but I'm about to show you why that's not always always the case so a super super important thing to do is to figure out whether or not this thing is actually providing the returns you expect by being very clear on what those KPIs are going to be for example if you take an STR uh a team of SCRs 10 STRs and you know or appointment setters and like inbound leads come in they got to call those leads and they got to convert them from like warm to like a booked call and there's like an expected conversion rate there right so it's like you know hey you guys don't necessarily have the power over like how many leads inbound leads come in but like the conversion rate must be like 80% uh from like warm lead they enter the the lead form to booked call for the sales executive to like hop on the call and try to close them it's like okay cool now let's say we implement an agentic system that has a conversion rate of 70% right or 65% so it's obviously worse than what the human STR is but it makes up for it by calling people a lot faster following up uh a lot more frequently and diligently being available to call leads at any time right any day and so you can see that simply by doing a lot of those intangibles could increase the actual topline revenue at the end of the day could increase the total number of booked meetings at the end of the day even if the conversion rate is lower and so if you're looking at a KPI it's not always going to be onetoone the KPIs that you look at with your human team and the KPIs you look at with your system right because quality might decrease but if you can make up for it with volume it's it's it might be totally worth it right so like make sure that the KPI you're looking at is the right one to look at right like what's the ultimate goal here is the ultimate goal like topline revenue uh is the ultimate goal like margin increase like are we trying to decrease opex what is the ultimate goal and then how can we judge the system on whether or not it's getting there in this case it was cost savings right what are the cost savings over time what are the productivity gains over time what's the revenue growth over time that third one is kind of like the we're not too too worried about that third one but we do want to see those numbers right so we can come back here and say "Hey we saw this revenue growth." Right when you look at month three to month six the jump there the jump is pretty steep i might have to I might have to look at the math what's going on there anyway uh the key point is 100% realization in the first year right technically nine months technically eight months actually yeah if you do the math it's it's probably actually eight months decision-m framework right should you actually do it or not because all of them are going to say you're going to get ROI because OBEX is going to be slashed right that that the labor cost is going to be cut so they're it's going to say hey this is positive ROI but you know you want to be smart about it so there's probably about four checks here in this check box which is like are you going to see the ROI in year one yes but like how much of it are you going to see is it going to be 100% or is it going to be like two right it's a go if it's if it's greater than 75 in year one payback period are you going to get paid back on your investment within the first year right if it's if it is within the first year it's a go for sure for sure go another one that I like to that I think is really important is can the AI actually like reliably execute the workflows because if it cannot then cost like dealing with those mistakes or complexities or the habit change of like an employee that's like a whole whole job is to like keep this thing you know on track is going to end up costing more right and then success can you actually clearly define success or is this going to be like you know a marketing team for like Geico where it's like like are you guys actually you what value are you actually doing it or are you just kind of like checking off you know a bunch of boxes like yeah we we did our our Super Bowl ad yeah we did we did this ad yeah we had this brochure we did this event like or are you guys actually is there ROI here right with the marketing team caution obviously you know you can play with these numbers but for us it's Okay you know the ROI is between 30 to 75% within the first year they're likely going to get paid back within 18 months some of these processes are pretty complex to handle so instead of like doing 90 95% of the function we're really looking at like 60% 50% of the function and then success is kind of like a you know it when you see it type of thing these admin rules these operating rules are very much feel like um you know it when you see it right which it's it's a challenge to put numbers to it because then you start feeling like you're making stuff up and then stop when ROI is below 30% you're not going to get paid back for you know 18 plus months again this is for like midm markets and SMBs like if you're an enterprise obviously you're you're the decisions you make are over a 3 to 5 year time horizon and so there's a little bit different calculus happening here on whether or not you make that decision can the AI technology do it right if it cannot don't do it a majority of the workflows and then if if you cannot clearly define success I wouldn't do it even if all the other things are are green uh let me not say that let me not say that cuz there are some cases where you do if it's like an assistant type deal if it's just like a like a like a rag function or uh like a search right so real result summary obviously the decision was a go reduced team overhead by about 84% missed deadlines went down to almost like there there's There's almost like no missed deadlines um but I'm not going to put 100% execution accuracy went up to 95% like went up by 95% almost zero mistakes parallegals are no longer spending 5 hours a week our conservative ROI is 124% or was actual is 254 right and you always want to be conservative key takeaways total cost is much more than just salaries and pay payroll don't stop at simply the labor costs um or the operating costs look at those hidden inefficiencies right how much is that actually costing you and if you can look at the opportunity cost right if you don't do this thing how much is it costing you seriously because everybody everybody's going to do it at some point eventually that opportunity cost starts to grow and get much much larger right and that net net benefit starts to decline because now you're competing against people who have this stuff like now is the time anyway ROI compounds over time right started at 131% increases to 2200 within 5 years and then I would always model things conservatively from an ROI perspective because there's a lot of assumptions being made and you just don't want to be crazy about any of this stuff it's already crazy you don't need to be even crazier and then find the flywheel so as you're doing this stuff and you're learning about the current workflows and how much it costs and who all has to get involved in this stuff and all this right it starts to become like pretty clear what are the biggest bottlenecks uh but the biggest bottlenecks aren't always the biggest cost drivers right you could have a functioning workflow that's producing really good results and reliable and you like it a lot and it just works right and you're not thinking like oh man I really this is such a huge painoint I really need uh an agentic system in you know to replace what I have going on right now you're not thinking that because it's like working uh but the reality is like if you could reduce the cost by like 90% the cost it takes to produce the same outcome by 90% then you will feel higher ROI right by implementing the system in that workflow that's like working and it's usually those workflows where the costs like as you're scaling the costs rise sublinearly so like each unit of cost you know decreases the rate of growth of the cost is decreasing every time and then the returns could rise exponentially how it's hardly ever exponential but when you start to think about the growth capital that you get the IBIDA margin like or the IBA margin the IBIDA increase right like the the the capital that you have left over to reinvest back into the business that's where you start to see like oh okay this is where things could actually get exponential but yeah you could reach like pretty significant economies of scale inside your current operations if you go after the right function right and all of that stuff can all that cash generated right that extra cash could be reinvested into building other agentic operating systems for the other parts of the business right uh and that's it right that's our ROI calculation i'll likely look back on this video in a few months and think man that was so rudimentary but anyway I built this little thing uh little little page you can go click the link down in the description to access it it allows you to kind of like quickly put together an ROI calculation so I just had random right department function name process description so this would be like uh administration this would be like legal or this could be like legal assistant this could be scheduling document management billing entries etc you know operational costs that are not FTE meaning like full-time employee then you want to talk about each of the workflows that they're doing so again just random letters but this would be like scheduling with opposing councils document management billing entries all the things that I mentioned hours spent how many employees are involved in like producing the outcome here managing that process and then what is like the average cost per employee right and then what is the error rate this isn't done by the way like I'm going to clean this it might look a little bit different by the time you guys get it because this is a weird like dark to light it should be opposite anyway if you can't tell it's lovable shout out lovable and then the expected state so we'll pull over like everything you put for the current and have you put in like what is the expected outcome now if if you haven't talked to a team uh who builds these systems and can basically tell you like hey you know this is the the volume that you can expect here's how long it'll likely take with an agentic system doing it as opposed to a person or a team make your best guess ask Chat JBT I guess yeah and that's it and then you hit calculate ROI and then you get this nice little dashboard showing up here
