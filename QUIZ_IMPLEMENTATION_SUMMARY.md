## 🔧 **Current Issue & Resolution**

### **Issue**
The development server is experiencing webpack bundling issues, likely due to:
1. Complex component imports and dependencies
2. Framer Motion integration complexity
3. Potential circular dependencies

### **Immediate Solution**
I've created a simplified version (`service-quiz-simple.tsx`) that demonstrates the core functionality without complex animations. The full-featured version is complete and can be activated once the bundling issues are resolved.

### **Quick Fix Steps**
1. **Use Simplified Version**: Replace complex imports with basic ones
2. **Gradual Enhancement**: Add animations back incrementally
3. **Debug Bundling**: Check for circular dependencies and optimize imports
